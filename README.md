A police Mobile Data Terminal system designed for use on the FiveM platform with the ESX framework.


This is not created by me but done some edits.

# Language system
- Operating on the new ESX locales. / TranslateCap
- ui - On changing the language, change the ui/index_*.html to index.html so you have the belonged language in the mdc.


# Notes
- vehicle_names.lua is a file where you can define custom vehicle names. So far I catagorized it by brand. But it's just an example.
- To change the Politie image. ui > badges.
